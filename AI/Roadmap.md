I'm a full-stack developer transitioning into **AI-native engineering**. With hands-on experience in end-to-end AI systems, I focus on integrating LLMs, agents, RAG, multimodal AI, and production-grade MLOps into full-stack applications. Passionate about turning complex data and models into reliable, user-facing products.

Currently upskilling aggressively (Jan–Apr 2026) to become an "evolved" AI full-stack engineer — mastering agent orchestration, scalable inference, secure deployment, and domain-aware AI.
